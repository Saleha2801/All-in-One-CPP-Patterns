# All-in-One-CPP-Patterns
A collection of C++ programs demonstrating various pattern printing techniques using loops. Includes squares, triangles, number patterns, and star patterns.

This repository contains multiple C++ programs to print different types of patterns using nested loops. 

Patterns included:
- Solid and hollow squares
- Right-angled and inverted triangles
- Number-based patterns
- Star-based patterns
- Pyramid and diamond shapes

Each program is written in a modular way with separate functions for each pattern. Designed for learning and practicing C++ loops and control structures.
